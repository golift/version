# version

Version Library for Go

This is a simple library to give you external version and build info.

Lifted directly from [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/common/blob/317b7b125e8fddda956d0c9574e5f03f438ed5bc/version/info.go).
The prometheus-specific code was removed. 

This will be maintained and issues / pull requests accepted.
